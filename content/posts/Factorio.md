In the realm of gears and steam, Where conveyor belts weave like a dream, Factorio, the land of machination, A world born from imagination.

Iron and copper, ores of the earth, Fuel the factories, giving them birth. Belts intertwine in a rhythmic dance, Engines hum in a hypnotic trance.

Pipes hiss with the steam's hot breath, In this symphony of progress and death. Automatons toil under the sun and moon, To the rhythm of the industrial tune.

Rails stretch far across the land, Guiding trains with a steady hand. Resources flow in an endless tide, In this empire where machines preside.

But beware the planet's silent roar, Nature's guardians, impossible to ignore. In this world of iron and flame, Survival in Factorio is the ultimate game.

A dance of progress, a test of wits, In this land where the engineer sits. Building, creating, a world anew, In Factorio, the limits are few.
